written with no external dependencies for *nix-like POSIX-compliant systems  
implementation of a server-client communication method using SSE, as a method to interact with the DOM  
cerv's SSE implements a daemon with planned asynchronous support for efficient single-thread handling of multiple clients. functionality heavily inspired by [hasses](https://github.com/hyper-prog/hasses?tab=readme-ov-file) by [hyper-prog](https://github.com/hyper-prog)  
if you need something robust with this functionality, rely on hasses. this is most probably nowhere near as effective as hasses, and does not even have the same feature-set<br><br>
installation, build instructions, and how-to WIP
